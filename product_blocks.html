                    <p>Investing is more risky than saving.</p>
                    <p>With savings, you have the security of earning steady returns - through interest payments - but with investments, you take a risk on whether you make a profit or loss.</p>
                    <p>A person should only invest if they are prepared to take the risk that their investments could go down, as well as up, in value.</p>

                  <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>The stock market is where different company shares (very small percentages of ownership) are listed, sold and bought.</p>
                    <p>Companies sell shares in a bid to boost funds available to invest, by offering investors the chance to back them financially.</p>
                    <p>The shareholder then gains returns on the business profits (via dividend and changes in the share value) - but if the company makes losses, the shareholder potentially will as well.</p>
                    <p>Share prices continually rise and fall. This can be dictated by a number of factors, including the company’s financial performance and the general economic position in any one country or globally.</p>
